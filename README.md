# README for UIF 1.1.9

## Documentation

The UIF project has been developed for a diskless router system and provides
a mechanism to create and simplify packet filter rules. It forces you to
provide names for every value you use in order to make firewalls less
confusing.

Please have a look at the man pages for uif(8) and uif.conf(5). There
are also example configurations in the docs/ directory.

There is some LDAP support built-in, with that you can handle a big farm
of diskles router configurations. Use uif(8) and information provided in
the doc/ directory to configure the firewall fitting your needs.


## Bugs / Wishlist

UIF is on Github. If you've found a bug, or have suggestions for future
versions please report it via the project's issue tracker:
https://github.com/cajus/uif/issues

If you have installed UIF on Debian, you can also use the Debian BTS for
reporting bugs. As the Debian maintainer of UIF is a member of the UIF
upstream development team, the Debian bugs will also reach upstream quickly.


Have fun,
