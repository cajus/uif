.Nd Tool for generating optimized packet filter rules
.ds Default configuration file for uif
.Sh DESCRIPTION
First of all, the syntax of this configuration file is far from being
perfect. If you've got some better ideas just drop me a line...
.Ar /etc/uif/uif.conf
is the default configuration file for
.Xr uif 8 .
This file may contain several sections and comments. Each
section begins with the section name and the left curly brace and ends with
the right curly brace in a single line. A comment starts with a hash mark
.Cm (#)
at the beginning of a line.
.Pp
Blank lines are silently ignored. The following sections are valid:
.Cm include, include4, include6, sysconfig, service, network, interface, marker, filter, nat, input, output, forward, masquerade
and 
.Cm stateless.  
.Pp
The sections 
.Cm service, network, marker
and 
.Cm interface
have all a very similar syntax.
Each line starts with an identifier followed by one or more blanks and one
or more section specific entries or defined identifiers separated by blanks.
A valid identifier is case sensitive and consists of letters, digits,
underscores and hyphens.
.Pp
If two or more identifiers in one section are equal, the corresponding
entries are merged to the first identifier. Hence, it's not possible to
overwrite previously defined identifiers. As a result the order of the
section entries is irrelevant and it's possible to define a section more
than once.
.Ss include section
Include other configuration files. Each line in this section, enclosed in
quotation marks ("), must be a valid filename. The contents of this file are
added to the actual configuration file and each file should contain at least
one section (a comment only file is not really useful...).
.Ss include4 section
Include other configuration files but ONLY in IPv4 mode (WITHOUT \-6 switch to uif).
Otherwise equivalent to the include section above.
.Ss include6 section
Include other configuration files but ONLY in IPv6 mode (WITH \-6 switch to uif).
Otherwise equivalent to the include section above.
.Ss sysconfig section
Set some global settings. Each line in this section starts with one of the
following identifiers followed by one or more blanks and the desired value:
.Cm LogLevel, LogPrefix, LogLimit, LogBurst, Limit, Burst
and
.Cm AccountPrefix.
If there are multiple definitions of one entry the last definition is stored.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm LogLevel
A valid default log priority (see 
.Xr syslog.conf 5)
.It Cm LogPrefix
The default log prefix. Each iptables logmessage starts with this prefix. 
.It Cm LogLimit
The default limit value for logmessages (see 
.Xr iptables 8)
.It Cm LogBurst
The default burst value for logmessages (see
.Xr iptables 8) 
.It Cm Limit
The default limit value (see 
.Xr iptables 8)
.It Cm Burst
The default burst value (see 
.Xr iptables 8) 
.It Cm AccountPrefix
The default prefix for accounting chains.

.Ss service section
This section defines all needed services. A service
description starts with the
protocol (see 
.Xr protocols 5)
followed by parameters in parenthesis. Most
protocols don't need any parameters. The only exceptions are tcp, udp and
icmp. The tcp and udp parameter defines the source and destionation
port(\-range). The source and destination ports are separated by a slash (/)
and portranges are separated by a colon (eg. tcp(123:333/99): tcp protocol,
source\-portrange 123\-333, destination port 99). Empty source or destination
ports are expanded to 1:65535. The icmp protocol parameter must be a valid
icmp type (see iptables \-p icmp \-\-help).
.Ss network section
This section defines all needed networks and hosts. A network description
starts with a valid IPv4 address (dotted quad), an optional netmask in cidr
notation (number of bits) or an optional MAC\-address (with a prefixed equal
sign (=). Some valid entries are: 127.0.0.1 127.0.0.0/8
192.168.0.1=00:00:00:00:00:FF.
.Ss interface section
This section defines all needed (physical and bridged) interfaces (eg. eth0, lo, ppp0).
.Ss marker section
This section defines all needed numerical (decimal) values for packet
marking purposes.
.Ss filter, nat, input, output, forward, masquerade and stateless sections
Due to better partitioning of the packetfilter, rules can be split into
these sections. Internally they are equivalent and contain all
rules. As an exception to all other sections the order of entries in
these sections is important. 
.Pp
The default policy for the chains INPUT, OUTPUT and FORWARD is DROP (see
.Xr iptables 8)
and it's not possible to change this.
.Pp
Each line in in this section begins with 
.Cm in, out, fw, nat, masq, slin, slout
or 
.Cm slfw
followed by '+', '\-' or a mark identifier enclosed in curly braces (or, in
case of fw followed by '>').  The identifiers
.Cm in, out 
and
.Cm fw
define rules for incoming, outgoing and forwarded
IP\-packets. Each packet with an INVALID state (see 
.Xr iptables 8)
is matched by
.Cm slin, slout
and
.Cm slfw.
The lines starting with
.Cm nat
and
.Cm masq
define rules to modify the source
or destination address or the destination port.
.Pp
\fBNote:\fR The identifiers nat and masq are non-operational in IPv6
mode. They simply get ignored as NAT and Masquerading are not supported by
the IPv6 protocol.
.Pp
The plus and minus signs specify the type of the rule: '+' accepts matching
packets and '\-' drops them. As a special case the identifier out and fw
accept the greater than (>) sign to modify the MSS depending on the PMTU
(see
.Xr iptables 8) 
.Pp
A very basic ruleset may look like this:
.Cm out+
.Pp
This allows every outgoing traffic and rejects all incoming connections
(because of the default policy).
.Pp
To be more specific, each line may contain several parameters. Each
parameter starts with a single character followed by an equal sign (=) and
one or more previously defined identifiers (in the corresponding sections)
separated by commas. The following parameters are valid:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm s
The source address or network. Append "(4)" or "(6)" to the network name to make this rule apply to IPv4 or IPv6 only.
.It Cm d
The destination address or network. Append "(4)" or "(6)" to the network name to make this rule apply to IPv4 or IPv6 only.
.It Cm i
The input interface.
.It Cm o
The output interface.
.It Cm pi
The physical input interface (only useful when used with bridged interfaces).
.It Cm po
The physical output interface (only useful when used with bridged interfaces).
.It Cm p
The service description (protocol).
.It Cm m
The mark field associated with a packet.
.It Cm S
The the new source address in nat rules. Supported in IPv4 mode only. Ignored in IPv6 mode.
.It Cm D
The the new destination address in nat rules. Supported in IPv4 mode only. Ignored in IPv6 mode.
.It Cm P
The the new service description in nat rules. This is only valid with tcp or
udp packets.
.It Cm f
This parameter sets some 'flags'. A flag definition starts with the flag
identifier and optional parameters in parenthesis. Valid flags are:
.Pp
.Cm log
\- Logs matching packages to syslog. The given parameter is included in the log
entry. The number of logged packets and the loglevel can be set in the
sysconfig section.
.Pp
.Cm reject
\- Only valid in DROP rules. This is used to send back an error packet in
response to the matched packet. The default behaviour is a packet with set
RST flag on tcp connections and a destination\-unreachable icmp packet in
every other case. Valid parameters are listed in
.Xr iptables 8
in the REJECT section.
.Pp
.Cm account
\- Create an accounting chain for all matching packages and possible responses.
The optional parameter is a part of the name of the chain.
.Pp
.Cm limit
\- Limits the number of matching packets. The default values are set in the
sysconfig section. Other values can be defined with the optional parameter.
The first entry sets a new limit and the second parameter (separated by a
comma (,)) sets the burst value (see Limit and Burst in sysconfig section). 
.El
It's possible to invert the identifier of one of following parameters \- if it
expands to ecactly one object \- by prepending a exclamation mark (!): 
.Cm s, d, i, o, p
(eg.: s=!local p=!http).
.Sh FILES
Configuration files are located in /etc/uif. There is a sample configuration
